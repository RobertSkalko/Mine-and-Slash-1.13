2.2.5
initial update to forge 1.14.4, probably unstable. Doesn't work on 1.14.3!
reduced mob spell resist
added level penalty advacement
more code reworks, this time item types and their data.
please check if auto salvage bags work right along with salvage stations and item modification
2.2.4 
added more mob configs, please test if they work! (stuff like min lvl, min rarity, lvl modifier etc. hp multi.)
fixed runewords
fixed runes
2.2.3
reworked my registry system so it uses my registry classes instead of plain old hashmaps. This should reduce crashes as now instead of returning null, it returns empty or default classes in case no key is in the registry
unstable because this needs to be tested a bit to make sure everything works, but should increase stability in the long run.
2.2.2
renamed my code packages to include both my curseforge name and my mod name
added a super rare ring unique
should fix /restorelevel not working
fix crash on unknown stat. now it shouldn't crash anymore, but just give a warning, and only once 
2.2.0
fix capacitors being extracted
added 4 new spells. bonus dmg on weapon hits! For all those who don't like the spell system much and prefer to use weapons.
unique items should now be enchantable
weapons should now be able to get weapon enchants
nerfed hp per lvl a bit (needs config delete/adjust)
swords are now faster (i think?)
fixed rune tooltips wrong numbers
made rare maps less rare
trying to fix atk speed to be more fluid
improved projectile targeting a bit
added item for clearing runes and runewords from an item
most spells have their cast speed increased
tweaked some code to be cleaner, could cause weird bugs
created a level backup system. there's a command /restorelevel that any1 can use. it restores the highest level gotten by that player
added an item that adds group affix to map
made nova hit more consistently i hope
added 2 high lvl sets
